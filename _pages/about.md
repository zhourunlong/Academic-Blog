I am a third-year PhD student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.
I feel very fortunate to have worked under the guidance of Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) since 2020.

My research focuses on machine learning and its theories, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs).
Currently, I'm researching reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the physics of language models, and LLM reasoning.

For the spring of 2025, I'm working as a part-time intern at Microsoft Research, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Baolin Peng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baolinpeng/).
I spent the summer of 2024 at Microsoft AI, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Yi Zhang](https://www.yi-zhang.me/) and the summer of 2023 at Microsoft Research, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Beibin Li](https://www.beibinli.com/).
I graduated from Yaoclass, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2022.
My undergraduate thesis was jointly advised by Professor Simon Shaolei Du and Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).

During my undergraduate and secondary school years, I participated actively in the Olympiad of Informatics and ACM-ICPC.
