I am a first-year PhD student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in University of Washington.
I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) since 2020.

My research interests are primarily focused on theoretical reinforcement learning, specifically in deriving regret guarantees for tabular Markov decision processes and policy optimization.
Currently, I am working on researching tight horizon-free PAC bounds and liquidity provision for Uniswap V3.
This summer, I will begin researching the application of transformer models to online operations research.

I graduated from Yaoclass, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in Tsinghua University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2022.
My undergraduate thesis was jointly advised by Professor Simon Shaolei Du and Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).
