I am a third-year PhD student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in University of Washington.
I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) since 2020.

My research interests primarily focus on reinforcement learning and its theories.
Currently, I'm researching reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and physics of language models.

I spent the summer of 2024 at Microsoft AI, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Yi Zhang](https://www.yi-zhang.me/) and the summer of 2023 at Microsoft Research, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Beibin Li](https://www.beibinli.com/).
I graduated from Yaoclass, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in Tsinghua University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2022.
My undergraduate thesis was jointly advised by Professor Simon Shaolei Du and Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).
