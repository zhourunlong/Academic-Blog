I am a third-year PhD student at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.
I feel very fortunate to have worked under the guidance of Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) since 2020.
I also work closely with Professor [Maryam Fazel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/).

My research focuses on machine learning and its theories, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs).
Currently, I'm researching reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), RL theories, and LLM reasoning.

I'm working (and have worked) as an intern at Microsoft Research, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Baolin Peng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/baolinpeng/) in Spring 2025, Dr. [Yi Zhang](https://www.yi-zhang.me/) in Summer 2024, and Dr. [Beibin Li](https://www.beibinli.com/) in Summer 2023.
I graduated from Yaoclass, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at Tsinghua University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2022.
My undergraduate thesis was jointly advised by Professor Simon Shaolei Du and Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).

During my undergraduate and secondary school years, I participated actively in the Olympiad in Informatics and ACM-ICPC.
