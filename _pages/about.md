I am a second-year PhD student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in University of Washington.
I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/) since 2020.

My research interests primarily focus on reinforcement learning and its theories.
Currently, I'm researching reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and physics of language models.
I'm working under the supervision of Dr. [Yi Zhang](https://www.yi-zhang.me/) at Microsoft Redmond in the summer of 2024.

I spent the summer of 2023 at Microsoft Research, Redmond, under the supervision of Dr. [Beibin Li](https://www.beibinli.com/).
I graduated from Yaoclass, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in Tsinghua University with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2022.
My undergraduate thesis was jointly advised by Professor Simon Shaolei Du and Professor [Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).
