collection: publications
authors: '**Runlong Zhou**, Zihan Zhang, Simon S. Du'
excerpt: 'We provide a systematic study of variance-dependent regret bounds of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning for tabular MDPs. The proposed model-based algorithm is both optimal for stochastic and deterministic MDPs.'
