title: "Horizon-Free and Variance-Dependent Reinforcement Learning for Latent Markov Decision Processes"
collection: publications
authors: '**Runlong Zhou**, Ruosong Wang, Simon S. Du'
excerpt: 'We provide an algorithm framework for Latent MDPs (with context in hindsight), achieving the first horizon-free minimax regret. We complement the study by giving a novel regret lower bound for LMDPs using the symmetrization technique.'
