title: "Sharp Gap-Dependent Variance-Aware Regret Bounds for Tabular MDPs"
collection: preprints
authors: 'Shulun Chen, **Runlong Zhou**, Zihan Zhang, Maryam Fazel, Simon S. Du'
excerpt: "We propose a novel analysis of gap-dependent regrets by introducing a necessary term named maximum conditional total variance. The proposed model-based algorithm is tight on both the horizon and the variance dependencies."
